# txApi
FiveM exports for txAdmin. Ban players using txAdmin instead of using another ban system. 
With this you can keep all your bans in one place and make moderating way easier!

## Installation
1. Add this to your server's resources folder.
2. Create a new txAdmin user with the permissions of the exports you want to use.
3. Login to this user to set a password.
4. Enter user credentials in `config.json`
5. Start txApi before all your scripts that use it. You can do this by adding `ensure txApi` to the top of your `server.cfg`
6. Restart your server!
